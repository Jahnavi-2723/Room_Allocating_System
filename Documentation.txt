I created only frontend part of the project because i don't know how to use backend part.
In Source_code1 file there is a html code will calls a css file "style.css" and a javascript file "script.js".
Frontend Requirements:
    A user-friendly interface to upload two CSV files.
    Display the allocated rooms indicating which group members are in which room.
    Provide a downloadable CSV file with the allocation details.
    Usage Instructions
Uploading CSV Files:
    Open the web application.
    Upload the Group Information CSV file.
    Upload the Hostel Information CSV file.
    Click on the "Allocate Rooms" button.
Viewing Allocation Results:
    The application will process the CSV files and allocate rooms based on the provided criteria.
    The allocated rooms will be displayed on the page.
Downloading Allocation Results:
      A downloadable CSV file with the allocation details will be provided.
Allocation Logic
The room allocation algorithm works as follows:
    Parse the CSV files to get the data for groups and hostels.
    Segregate hostels based on gender (boys' hostels and girls' hostels).
    Iterate through each group and allocate rooms:
    If a group has both boys and girls, handle them separately.
    Allocate group members to the respective hostels, ensuring the room capacity is not exceeded.
    Try to allocate the entire group to the same room as much as possible.
    If a room cannot accommodate the entire group, split the group across multiple rooms.
    Store the allocation details and display the results.
